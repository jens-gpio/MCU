This repository contains D startup files for ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers.

For more info about the D language, please visit dlang.org

The files in the startup/ directory are ready for use.
Just copy one of them to your src/ directory.

To create a new startup file, all you have to do, is ...
1: Go to the templates/ directory
2: CD into the desired vendor's prefix (creating a new folder if needed)
3: Create and open a new file ending in .v
4: List all the exception vectors in the correct order starting from the Reset_Handler
5: Save the file
6: Run ../bin/generate
7: Your new startup file should now appear in the startup/ directory; copy it to your src/ folder
